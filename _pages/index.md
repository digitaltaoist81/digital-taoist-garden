  <p>[!abstract] What is this site about? <br>
A Digital Garden is an online space <br>
forming an evolving collection of <br>
interconnected notes, ideas and resources.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Welcome to my little <br>
corner of the online universe.</p>

<p>As a Digital Taoist, <br>
expect to read about <br>
the connection between <br>
<span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  taoism  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span> and <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  fitness  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span>, philosophy, psychology, cooking, programming, entrepreneurship,  agriculture, money, languages, music, house, social, books, anime or films.</p>

<p>This project came to life <br>
thanks to the concepts of <br>
<a class="internal-link" href="/linking-your-thinking">Linking your thinking</a>, <br>
<span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  Building in public  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span> and <br>
the Chapter 81 from the <br>
Tao Te Ching.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-navigate-this-site">How to navigate this site</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
<strong>Links and Backlinks</strong>: As a free pirate, you can randomly navigate through notes using the links and connections from each note.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Main Index</strong>: When you get trapped in a rabbit hole, feel free to click on the top-left main title <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Digital Taoist</code> to go back to this starter note.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Visual Graph</strong>: If you happen to be a visual thinker just like me, a visual graph is added at the bottom of each note showcasing the connections between notes. Just click on the dots to teleport yourself into that idea.</li>
</ol>
