Mindful Cooking means to 
bring mindfulness practices 
into your kitchen.

Cooking as if it was a meditation.
Or if you know [[Tai Chi]] , 
then do [[Everything is Tai Chi]].
Being present in each moment. 

Connecting all our senses 
with each ingredient and phase 
of the process. 

> When you cook mindfully, 
> you're not just mechanically chopping vegetables 
> or stirring a pot. 
> You're aware of every color, scent, and texture, 
> and you're fully engaged in creating something nourishing. 
> Mindful cooking can help contribute to a happier, 
> more focused, and more satisfying life.

Regard the kitchen as a sacred temple. 
This is something we can improve regarding 
the [[How Mysthisism is missing from our modern world]].
