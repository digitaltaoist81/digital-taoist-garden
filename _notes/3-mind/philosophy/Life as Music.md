title: Life as Music
---
I love this idea from Alan Watts 
about regarding **life as a musical thing**. 

This concept has helped me quite a lot 
so I hope this can also help you as well. 

This is the extract regarding the concept: 

_Music as an art form is essentially playful, 
you say you “play the piano”, you don’t work the piano. 
Why?_

_Music differs from say travel, 
when you travel you are trying to get somewhere. 
And of course we, because being a very compulsive and_  
_purposeful culture, are busy getting everywhere faster and faster and_  
_faster; until we eliminate the distance between places. I mean, with_  
_modern jet travel you can arrive instantaneously. What happens as a_  
_result of that is that the two ends of your journey becomes the same_  
_place. So you eliminate the distance and you eliminate the journey, but_  
_the fun of the journey is to travel, not to obliterate the travel._

_So then, in music, though, 
one doesn’t make the end of the composition, 
the point of the composition._

_If that was so the best conductors would be those who play fastest, and_  
_there would be composers who wrote only finales! People would go to_  
_concerts just to hear one crashing chord, because that’s the end!_

_Same with dancing. You don’t aim at a particular spot in the room,_  
_that’s where you should arrive, the whole point of dancing is the dance._  
_Look at the people who live to retire, put those savings away; and then_  
_when they’re 65 they don’t have any energy left, more or less impotent;_  
_they go and rot in an old people’s senior citizen’s community. Because_  
_we’ve simply simply cheated ourselves the whole way down the line._

_We thought of life by analogy, with a journey, with a pilgrimage, which_  
_had a serious purpose at the end; and the thing was to get to that end,_  
_success or maybe heaven after you’re dead._

_But, we missed the point the whole way along, it was a musical thing and_  
_you were supposed to sing or to dance while the music was being played._

_That existence is musical in nature._
