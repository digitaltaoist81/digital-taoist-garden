Emotions are *Psychophysiological* 
states that we all experience 
as humans in our day to day life. 

They are a **survival response** 
that our system has learned 
in order to navigate through life. 

This means that each emotion 
**carries critical information** about 
what goes through our life and how 
our instinct is telling us to act.

### The 7 Basic Emotions 

Paul Ekman, a well known psychologist 
whose work focus is the study of emotions, 
has identified these 7 basic emotions: 

1. [[Emoci√≥n Miedo]] :: As a response to activate the danger response system. 
2. [[Emocion Tristeza]] :: When we experience loss, change or impermanence of life.
3. [[Emocion Ira]] :: Our limits have been crossed or we suffer an injustice. 
4. [[Emocion Joy]] :: The energy of expansion, connectivity and freedom. 
5. [[Emocion Sorpresa]] :: Fast alert mechanism when something unexpected happens. 
6. [[Emocion Asco]] :: This saves us from preventing to eat toxic or poisonous food. 
7. [[Emocion Desprecio]] :: Something that is deeply rooted in our societies.
