title: Linking Your Thinking
---
This is what the [[Digital Garden]] is about. 
Connecting ideas. 
Linking unrelated areas. 
Building links between \
inner thoughts and experiences. 

The "Linking your thinking" concept \
is a personal knowledge management (PKM) \
framework developed by *Nick Milo*.

Connecting notes feels like \
building a **second brain**. 

### Key Components 

1. **Map of Contents (MOC)**: They are the starting point for each of the topics or areas in your vault. They evolve through time instead of being static. 
2. **Atomic notes**: Notes should be as small and right to the point as possible. This makes the connection between ideas much easier. 
3. **Evergreen Notes**: Concepts that pass the exam of time. They will always be relevant. 
4. **Linking and Backlinking**: Using the power of Markdown to link between notes and create connections that may be displayed in Graph Views. Similar to how our brains function. 
5. **Daily Notes**: They serve as a daily point of contact with all the information. Managing logs and having a place to recall ideas or navigate.
