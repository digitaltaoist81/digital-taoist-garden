The Zuo Wang meditation is an 
advanced taoist practice. 

It consists of reaching the so-called 
"Empty State". 

This is one of the final phases 
when practicing [[Tai Chi]], 
where your body and mind 
become empty and one may experience 
a true connection with the [[Tao]] .

> “Our cultivation is to remain with our original nature, 
> then whatever arises is a natural activity of Dao.  
> Every action is wuwei.  
> In meditation you stay quiet and allow the mind to empty.  
> So wuwei means to remain empty and 
> be totally present with whatever you are doing."

> When thoughts dissolve into emptiness, 
> it means they have returned to the source, 
> which is non-being.  
> By becoming familiar with this experience, 
> gradually our activities become an expression of non-being.”

>  a part of a complete whole, a Oneness – Dao.”
