Chi is a crucial force in Taoism \
and in other Eastern philosophies. 

In Chinese culture, \
it is actually regarded as the energy of the Universe.  
Running through every being \
and non-being. 
Connecting us in many aspects. 

> [!hint] Chi in Dragon Ball
> Remember the qi of every character in Dragon Ball. \
> The more ‚Äòqi‚Äô, \
> the more powerful. 

The origin of the Chinese pictogram \
has multiple concepts. 

![[qi_character.webp]]

Imagine a concept that is simultaneously the air you breathe, \
the energy that gives you strength, \
the spirit that gives you courage, \
and the hot-headed feeling of being angry. 

That's¬†**Ê∞î (q√¨)**. 

## ‚ö°Ô∏èThe Chi within

What the [[Linking your thinking]] method does \
is connect the energy between \
every note, idea or concept. \
Letting the qi flow through our neural activity.

We can even perceive Chi in every emotion. \
All [[Emotions]] bring information and energy \
which can be transformed into Chi.

In Ancient China and Acupuncture, \
Chi is also deeply connected to our overall health. 

## üèî The Outside Chi

The notion of [[Feng shui]] is also related with \
how well the Chi is flowing inside \
a house or particular room. 

But Chi is also seen in the composition of Plants or vegetables. \
Eating a bowl of [[Microgreens]] may give you \
a condensed amount of minerals and vitamins, \
which can easily be turned into energy.

Coming from [[The Tao of Programming]], \
I like to see the Chi in every code base or application. \
If we see software as a living thing, \
the more robust, scalable, and efficient the code, \
the better Chi brings into the world.

## üêâ Cultivating Chi

We live in difficult times. \
That‚Äôs why it is more vital than ever \
to cultivate Chi so we can face any challenge \
or hardship that comes our way. 

These are some of the ways I use \
for keeping my Chi levels strong and balanced:

1. [[Tai Chi]]: This power can be harnessed and created by practicing activities such as [[Tai Chi]] or Kung Fu. 
2. [[ZuoWang Meditation]] :: The same way the usefulness of a house is in its empty space, we need to create empty space for the Chi to flow freely. 
3. [[Mindful Cooking]]: Giving our complete awareness to each step of the process. Cooking with good energy. So the food tastes even better.
4. [[Arigato Money]]: Regarding each penny as energy. Being grateful to the money that comes, but also to the one that goes away.
5. [[Life as Music]]: Singing or dancing as a way of enjoying the Chi of life.
