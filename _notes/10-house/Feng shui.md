> **Abstract** \
> **Feng shui**, sometimes calledÂ **Chinese geomancy**, is a traditional form ofÂ [geomancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomancy "Geomancy")Â that originated inÂ [ancient China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China "Ancient China"). The termÂ _feng shui_Â means, literally, "wind-water" (i.e., fluid). From ancient times,Â [landscapes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landscape "Landscape")Â andÂ [bodies of water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodies_of_water "Bodies of water")Â were thought to direct the flow of the universalÂ [[Chi]] â€“ "cosmic current" or energy â€“ through places and structures. 

Feng shui is simply put, \
how healthy an environment feels. 

If the environment has good feng shui, \
the [[Chi]] is flowing properly. 

If we regard [[Life as Music]], \
the more feng shui, \
the more harmony a place has. 

In the end is all about finding \
the balance between elements \
and human beings, animals and plants.
