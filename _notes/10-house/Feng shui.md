> [!info] Definition of Feng shui
> **Feng shui**, sometimes calledÂ **Chinese geomancy**, is a traditional form ofÂ [geomancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomancy "Geomancy")Â that originated inÂ [ancient China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China "Ancient China"). The termÂ _feng shui_Â means, literally, "wind-water" (i.e., fluid). From ancient times,Â [landscapes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landscape "Landscape")Â andÂ [bodies of water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodies_of_water "Bodies of water")Â were thought to direct the flow of the universalÂ [[Chi]] â€“ "cosmic current" or energy â€“ through places and structures. More broadly, feng shui includesÂ [astronomical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical "Astronomical"),Â [astrological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrological "Astrological"),Â [architectural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural "Architectural"),Â [cosmological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological "Cosmological"),Â [geographical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographical "Geographical"), andÂ [topographical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topographical "Topographical")Â dimensions.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feng_shui#cite_note-:0-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feng_shui#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKomjathy2012395-5)

Feng shui is simply put, 
how healthy an environment feels. 

If the environment has good feng shui, 
the [[Chi]] is flowing properly. 

If we regard [[Life as Music]], 
the more feng shui, 
the more harmony a place has. 

In the end is all about finding 
the balance between elements 
and human beings, animals and plants.
