---
*"Arigato Money"* is a concept where you \
express gratitude for your money, \
whether you are receiving it or spending it. 

The idea is to say "thank you" or "arigato" \
to your money when it comes into your life, \
like when you receive your paycheck, \
and also when it leaves your hands, \
like when you pay for groceries or bills. 

This practice helps you create a positive \
and respectful relationship with money, \
making it a source of joy rather than stress.

This concept comes from the [[Happy Money]] \
book written from Ken Honda. 

It is all about thinking about money as energy. 
Money as [[Chi]].
