title: The Tao of Programming

The Tao of Programming is a book \
written by Geoffrey James connecting \
Taoism philosophy concepts with \
programming foundations. 

It is written with a humorous style, \
and although it might not be serious, \
I feel that it has some deep meaning to it. 

This idea is related with the [[Everything is Tai Chi]] , \
where a tai chi master says that in the end, \
everything has its own [[Tao]] to it. 

Same for Programming. 
The [[Tao]] flows through every application. 
We can cultivate [[Chi]] using code. 
Principles such as [[Wu wei]] can be \
rightfully applied to Software Development.
