summary: Exploring microgreens through Senku's scientific lens — high nutrient density, rapid growth, and minimal resource usage.
title: Microgreens
---

Microgreens are the young seedlings 
of edible vegetables and herbs, 
harvested just after the cotyledon leaves develop. 

They pack intense flavor, 
concentrated nutrients, 
and can be grown in small spaces with minimal equipment. 

They’re the perfect intersection of *fast results* 
and *nutritional powerhouse*, 
making them an ideal candidate for 
**urban** and **space-age** agriculture.

In Taoist terms, 
they're the embodiment of [[Wu wei]],
minimal action, maximal return.
