# Chi 

[[Chi]] is a crucial force in Taoism and in other Eastern philosophies. 

In Chinese culture, it is actually regarded as the energy of the [[Universe]]. Running through every being and non-being. Connecting us in many aspects. 

> [!hint] Chi in Dragon Ball
> Remember the qi of every character in Dragon Ball. The more ‘qi’, the more powerful. 

The origin of the Chinese pictogram has multiple concepts.

Imagine a concept that is simultaneously the air you breathe, the energy that gives you strength, the spirit that gives you courage, and the hot-headed feeling of being angry. That's **气 (qì)**. 

## The Chi within

What the [[Linking your thinking]] method does is connect the [[Chi]] between every note, idea or concept. Letting the [[Chi]] flow through our neural activity.

We can even perceive [[Chi]] in every [[Emociones TAO]]. All [[Emociones TAO]] bring information and energy which can be transformed into [[Chi]]. 

We can also notice this in the [[Reading the room]] idea where the energy or ambiance in a social meeting is the outcome of the [[Chi]] of each player and situation.

In Ancient China and Acupuncture, [[Chi]] is deeply connected to our overall [[Health MOC]]. 

## The Outside Chi

The notion of [[Feng shui]] is also connected with how well the [[Chi]] is flowing inside a house or particular room.

But [[Chi]] is also seen in the composition of Plants or vegetables. Eating a bowl of [[Microgreens]] may give you a condensed amount of minerals and vitamins, which can easily be turned into [[Chi]]. 

Coming from [[The Tao of Programming]], I like to see the [[Chi]] in every code base or application. If we see software as a living thing, the more robust, scalable, and efficient, the better [[Chi]] brings into the world.
## Cultivating Chi

We live in difficult times. That’s why it is more important than ever to cultivate Chi so we can face any challenge or difficulty that comes our way. 

These are some of the ways I use for keeping my [[Chi]] levels balanced:

1. Tai Chi: This power can be harnessed and created by practicing activities such as [[Tai Chi]] or [[Kung Fu]]. 
2. [[ZuoWang Meditation Technique]] :: The same way the usefulness of a house is in its empty space, we need to create empty space for the [[Chi]] to flow freely. 
3. [[Mindful Cooking]] 
4. [[Arigato Money]] 
5. [[Life as Music]]
